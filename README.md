## Known Bugs:

# Notes
* FireFox has not implemented writing to clipboard, so I have implemented a workaround using local storage. That comes with the downside that you can only copy and paste colours if the sites are of the same origin. For example, you can copy/paste between two tabs that have \<link> open, but not between a tab with \<link> and a tab with `google.com`
